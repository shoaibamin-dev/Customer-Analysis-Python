# Custom Clustering Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`custome_cluster_code.ipynb`) that demonstrates custom clustering analysis on segmentation data. The dataset used for analysis is provided in the file `segmentation data.csv`.

## Content

### Jupyter Notebook
- **custome_cluster_code.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for the custom clustering analysis. The notebook includes explanations, visualizations, and comments to guide through the analysis.

### Dataset
- **segmentation data.csv:** CSV file containing the segmentation data used for clustering analysis.

## Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`custome_cluster_code.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the custom clustering analysis.
3. Explore the visualizations and insights provided in the notebook.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in the analysis:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Make sure to install these libraries before running the code.

## Usage

1. Load the segmentation data from the provided CSV file.
2. Perform clustering analysis on the 'Age' and 'Income' features.
3. Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots.
4. Explore insights from the analysis.

## Custom Clustering

The notebook demonstrates the process of clustering data into groups using the KMeans algorithm. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Standardization of features.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- Applying KMeans clustering.
- Visualizing the clustering results.
